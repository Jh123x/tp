## **Purpose of this guide**
This guide is made to help developers understand how McGymmy works.
One of the major goals is to centralise all the jimmy.mcgymmy documentation within McGymmy itself.
Another major goal is to better help developers extend McGymmy to improve on its features.

## A little note from the developers

Thank you for using MG. We sincerely hope that MG plays apart to help you achieve a healthier lifestyle.
We understand that MG may be a little different from traditional GUI applications and it may be a little difficult to start using it initially.
Thus, we recommend you to start by first understanding how MG works at a high level at the Quick start section. Then, explore the Features section.

## **General Information**
McGymmy (MG) is a **desktop app for managing diet and exercise, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, McGymmy can log your diet and exercise tasks, goals and progress done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" alt="Architectural diagram"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jimmy/mcgymmy/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jimmy/mcgymmy/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" alt="Architecture Sequence Diagram"/>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jimmy/mcgymmy/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FoodListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jimmy/mcgymmy/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jimmy/mcgymmy/logic/Logic.java)

We omit details of the `Macro` component in this section and will only focus on the parsing and execution of non-macro `Command`s.
For more information on macros and the full parsing process please read the section below.

1. `Logic` uses the `McGymmyParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `CommandExecutable` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a food item).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Note that our implementation of this component is different from the one in the parent project, AddressBook3.
One notable difference is the use of several `Parameter` classes in the various `Commands`.
We list a few of the benefits of our redesigned solution below.

1. The main motivation for this change was to facilitate the addition of the `macro` feature.
2. The old design of the parser operated at too high an abstraction level, resulting in the developer having to create hideous objects like the `EditPersonDescriptor` to implement basic functionality.
3. The new design allows us to code in a more declarative style which is more readable and arguably "self-documenting".
4. Hiding details of each `Parameter` behind an additional layer of abstraction allows us to automate the creation of other features such as parsers for each individual `Command` and automatially generating `help` strings.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

For more details on the new architecture you can refer to this [pull request](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/pull/39).
In particular, details on how to create new `Command`s are included in the pull request above.

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jimmy/mcgymmy/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the McGymmy data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Food>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in `McGymmy`, which `Food` references. This allows `McGymmy` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Food` needing their own `Tag` object.

<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jimmy/mcgymmy/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the McGymmy data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `jimmy.mcgymmy.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Clear feature

The clear feature extends model with the ability to delete all the items shown in the UI.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the clear mechanism works

Step 1. The user has decided that he wants to delete all filtered items based on taggings or names.

Step 2. The user uses the find command to search for the items to delete.

Step 3. The User executes `clear`.
The clear command will update the model to delete every occurences of food shown on the UI.
Otherwise, a CommandException will be thrown.

Step 4. Storage is then updated to be the same as model.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear operation works:

![ClearSequenceDiagram](images/ClearSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How clear executes

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** A refilter using predicate into a list and reupdate food items.

    * Pros: No traversal issue and no issue when food definition changes
    * Cons: Hard to implement

* **Alternative 2:** An enhanced for loop can be used to remove all occurences straight from the list.

    * Pros: Cleaner code and smaller and time space complexity
    * Cons: Code may break if food properties ever changes due to traversal error.


### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It keeps a filtered list (updated via a specified `Predicate`) of food items,
stored internally as a `FilteredList<Food>`. Additionally, it implements the following relevant operation:

* `ModelManager#updateFilteredFoodList(Predicate<Food>)` - Filters internal storage via a `Predicate<Food>` specification.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application after having used it for a while.

Step 2. The user wants to find what he ate for dinner on a certain date (eg. 21-10-2020).

Step 3. The user executes `find -n apple -t fruit`. The `find` command will check if the inputs are valid, and then parsed (similar to `delete`)
before using these inputs to create conditional `Predicate<Food>` instances (eg. `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `DatePredicate`). The predicates
are then combined and used to filter the `FilteredList<Food>`. The GUI will then display the food items in the filtered list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The method Parser::parse is a simplification of the overall parsing sequence which was already covered in showcasing the execution of the delete method. As such, redundant parsing details are not covered here.
</div>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Arguments for FindCommand

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Completely optional parameters, and ability to `find item` without a `flag`.
  * Pros: More flexibility for user, not restricted by parameter requirements.
  * Cons: Harder to implement, breaks general patten of `flag`-less arguments being compulsory parameters.

* **Alternative 2:** Compulsory `flag`-less name parameter
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: Less user-friendly, user restricted in use of method

##### Aspect: How find works

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filters Food with matching instance of at least one (assuming multiple arguments) argument for a given parameter
  * Pros: Easier to implement and easier to locate more things quickly.
  * Cons: Harder to locate specific food items.

* **Alternative 2:** Filters Food with matching instance of all arguments for a given parameter
  * Pros: Can locate specific food items easily; more narrowed-down search.
  * Cons: More difficult to find something over broad terms.

* **Alternative 3 (proposed best choice):** Allow variation in type of filtering through another optional parameter.
  * Pros: Combined Pros of Alternative 1 and 2, gives user greater autonomy.
  * Cons: Harder to implement, harder to use effectively.

### Import feature

The current Import feature is facilitated by `JsonMcGymmyStorage`.
It extends model with the ability to override the current data with an imported one.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the import mechanism behaves at each step

Step 1. The User just installed his application on his new computer and wants to transfer his old data over

Step 2. The user transfers his previous save file to `C:/McGymmy/saveFile.json`

Step 3. The User executes `import c:/McGymmy/saveFile.json`.
The import command will check if the file is valid and exists before calling `JsonMcGymmyStorage`.
`JsonMcGymmyStorage` will call `#readMcGymmy` if the read is successful, the old data will be overwritten.
Otherwise, a CommandException will be thrown.

Step 4. His old data files from his old computer will be overridden by his old data

The following sequence diagram shows how the import operation works:

![ImportSequenceDiagram](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The method Parser::parse is a simplification of the overall parsing sequence which was already covered in showcasing the execution of the delete method. As such, redundant parsing details are not covered here.
</div>

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How import executes

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** User keys in the filepath of the save file

    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Cons: Requires the user to key in path to file

* **Alternative 2:** User keys in path and McGymmy checks subdirectories for valid files

    * Pros: More convenient for the users
    * Cons: Increased implementation complexity (Prone to bugs), May have performance issues in terms of runtime.



### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
It stores multiple versions of `ReadOnlyMcGymmy` in a stack, with the most recent version on top.
Whenever there is a change to the data, `ModelManager` will store a copy of its `McGymmy` in the stack.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#canUndo()` - Checks if there are any older McGymmy states.
* `ModelManager#undo()` - Restores the previous McGymmy state from its history.
* `ModelManager#addCurrentStateToHistory` - Saves the current McGymmy state in its history.

The first 2 operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#canUndo()` and `Model#undo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized with the empty `mcGymmyStack`.

![UndoState0](images/UndoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th food item in the McGymmy.
The `delete` command calls `ModelManager#deleteFood(Index)`, which calls `ModelManager#addCurrentStateToHistory()`,
causing the stack to store a copied version of the McGymmy before any data changes happen.
Then McGymmy changes accordingly to delete the food at index 5.

![UndoState1a](images/UndoState1a.png)

![UndoState1b](images/UndoState1b.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add -n Rice â€¦â€‹` to add a new food item. The `add` command calls `ModelManager#addFood(Food)`, which also calls `ModelManager#addCurrentStateToHistory()`,
storing a copied version of the McGymmy into the stack before changing the McGymmy.

![UndoState2a](images/UndoState2a.png)

![UndoState2a](images/UndoState2a.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `ModelManager#addCurrentStateToHistory()`, so the McGymmy state will not be saved into the `mcGymmyStack`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the food item was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `ModelManager#undo()`,
which will pop the top most state from `mcGymmyStack`, and restores the McGymmy to that state.

![UndoState3](images/UndoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial McGymmy state, then there are no previous McGymmy states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoMcGymmy()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The method Parser::parse is a simplification of the overall parsing sequence which was already covered in showcasing the execution of the delete method. As such, redundant parsing details are not covered here.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![AddToHistoryActivityDiagram](images/AddToHistoryActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire McGymmy database.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the food item being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Macro Command

![Structure of the Macro Component](images/MacroClassDiagram.png)

As with the other class diagram for the *Logic* component above, we omit some details in the above diagram for clarity.

There are two 'parts' to the macro component:

1. The creation of the macro object itself (e.g. running `macro test a; add -n \a breakfast -c 100`).
2. The execution of the macro object (e.g. running `test -a tau sar pau`).

The creation of the macro object is straightforward as we defer most of the heavy lifting to during the execution of the macro.

#### A more complete picture of the parsing process

We only described parsing and execution of primitive commands in the section above.
A short description of the process including the parsing of macros is as follows:

1. If command word is `macro`, return a `NewMacroCommand` (which will create a new `macro` when executed).
2. Else if command word is an existing macro, call that macro object's `toCommandExecutable` method and return that.
3. Else hand over to primitive command parser.

#### Execution of macros

Here we detail what exactly happens in each macro's `toCommandExecutable` object.
Throughout this section, we will use the following macro as an example: `macro test a;add -n \a breakfast 200`.

1. Parameters supplied by the user are substituted into the macro's lines. For the example if the user enters `test -a rice`, `rice` will be substituted into the `\a` part of `add -n \a breakfast 200` to obtain `add -n rice breakfast 200`;
2. Pass the list of strings to a new instance of `PrimitiveCommandParser` to get a list of `Command`s. If a `ParseException` occurs, we recast it as a `CommandException` and re-throw it.
3. Execute all these `Command`s in sequence, and return a new `CommandResult` created from concatenating the respective `CommandResults` returned by the `Command`s. If a `CommandException` occurs in this sequence, that exception is thrown with the added message listing the commands that have executed successfully, and commands that have yet to be executed.

![Sequence diagram for macro](images/MacroSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Additional considerations for this implementation
Alternatively could have done the parsing/compiling on creation of the macro so we don't need to use another parser during execution.
That is, each macro instance could contain its own `ParameterSet` which could then be used by its callee functions.
This implementation is considerably more involved hence we proceeded with the current implementation.
